# Movie Match Application
## Setup Instructions
* After you have cloned the repository on your system, go to the **main** branch and create a new branch using your name

## Rules to push code to this Repo
* TO avoid unnecessary conflicts we will be keeping our production code separate from our development code
* We will have 3 branchs that each person will be working with
    1. yourName : Personal Development Branch
    2. dev : Development Branch, this will be used to merge the work done by all developers individially as well as test it
    3. main : Production Branch, this branch should always have stable working code.
* Any changes that you make to your branch should be pushed to the branch **yourName**, if they are stable, you can merge them with **dev**
* **DO NOT** merge your branch with **main** at any point
* The only branch that will be merged with **main** will be the **dev** branch **Only when the dev branch is stable and tested**
